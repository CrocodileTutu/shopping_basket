# Online Shopping Basket with Java Spring and Thymeleaf

## Technologies
+ JDK-17
+ Spring Boot 2.7.5
+ Maven 
+ MariaDB 10.5.15
+ Thymeleaf 3.0.15.RELEASE
+ Bootstrap 4.5.2 (CDN)


## Todo's
+ Create a database and call it "db_sales_tax" or alternatively rename it in "application.properties".
+ Adapt ports (Tomcat and DB) and hostname in "application.properties" if necessary.
+ After starting of Tomcat create some products on the "Vendor" page (default: http://localhost:8080 ).
+ The button "Vendor" is to preset the stock/store and the button "Buyer" is the shopping page. So first go to the "Vendor" page.
+ It is more or less self-explanatory and intuitive.
+ For Shopping Basket go to the "Buyer" page and add some items to Cart.
+ Do not forget to empty the shopping cart before you start a new order.
